            I'm an ambitious Computer Science student specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science 
            at Sunway College Kathmandu (affiliated with Birmingham University). My passion lies in leveraging 
            cutting-edge technology to create innovative solutions that make a real-world impact.

            With hands-on experience as a Data Annotator and LLM Trainer at Appen, I've worked with 
            Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to train 
            AI Large Language Models. I've optimized over 500 prompts and evaluated 1000+ AI model outputs 
            for accuracy, clarity, and helpfulness.

            My career goal is to become a leading AI Engineer, contributing to impactful projects that 
            push the boundaries of artificial intelligence. I bring strong leadership skills, excellent 
            communication abilities, and a deep understanding of AI and machine learning principles to 
            every project I undertake.
